Sapient Nitro Global Best Practices Repository

This document is an overview of Front End development standards that we adhere to at Sapient. These best practices are collected from the experiences we've had with numerous, large-scale projects, as well as a variety of web resources. These standards will help reduce friction in your workflows by providing a common starting point and will serve as a useful intro for both new hires and contractors.

If you ever had to merge 103 files with somebody's tabs-to-spaces changes, you'll know what we mean.
