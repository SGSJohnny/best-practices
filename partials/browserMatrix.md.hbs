### Browser Matrix

The typical NA/EU Browser at Sapient matrix looks like this:

#### Windows 7/8

<table class="browsers plain-table">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Internet Explorer</th>
			<td>9 - 11</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Firefox</th>
			<td>Latest stable</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Chrome</th>
			<td>Latest stable</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Safari</th>
			<td>no longer supported&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

#### Mac OS 10.9 - 10.10

<table class="browsers plain-table">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Firefox</th>
			<td>Latest stable</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
      <th>Chrome </th>
      <td>Latest stable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Safari</th><td>7 - 8</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Note that based on the client's analytics, sometimes legacy browsers such as Firefox 4.0 might need to be supported. A conversation around this should happen if current usage on the specific site is above 3% for a specific browser and not projected to drop below that until the go live date of the site or if specific business reasons demand support.

You might also consider a graded approach like described in [Yahooâ€™s graded browser support](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/tutorials/gbs).
